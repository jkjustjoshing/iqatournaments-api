Things to do and other thoughts


Message consistency
  When sending a 4xx or 5xx error, make the JSON response consistent, so errors can more easily be shown on the frontend.
  When a POST or PUT has incorrectly formatted data, the response should give a reason
  {
    message: 'Overall human readable error message, can be displayed in banner.',
    fields: {
      email: 'Duplicate field',
      name: 'Invalid character'
    }

  }

API Documentation
  Update Apiary docs

Duplicate detection
  Don't allow a team to play a game against themself, don't allow duplicate people on teams or duplicate teams in tournaments, etc.

Conflict detection
  Detect conflicts in a schedule for a tournament (maybe endpoint /tournament/{tournamentalias}/conflicts)

Person Creation
  Scenario: A tournament director wants to schedule a referee who doesn't have an account. In the autocomplete dropdown there should be a "add new person" link, which creates a new entry in the database. This should be claimable so it can be linked to an account in the future.

Ref flair
  Add ref certification field to a person (assistant, snitch, head)

Bcrypt
  Let passwords get encrypted. Also, implement password reset

Games
  Validate start time sent to game.
  More clearly differentiate between a past game and a future game.
